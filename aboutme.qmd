Hello! I am a second year MPH student at UGA concentrating in Biostatistics.  My goal is to work with data management systems in hospitals to streamline the process of healthcare data across several platforms.

# Background
I received my bachelor's degree in Biology from Georgia College & State University where I focused my studies in Biology Education.
