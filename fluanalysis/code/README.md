In this Flu Analysis, we use different files to process code and run additional analyses.

In the `wranging.qmd` file, we perform some simple data processing. (Module 8 & Module 11)

In the `exploration.qmd` file, we examine the data and identify potential predictors and response variables. (Module 8)

In the `fitting.qmd` file, we use the predictors and response variable to fit linear and logistic regression models to the data. (Module 8)

In the `modeleval.qmd` file, we evaluate the quality of the model using MSRE and ROC curves. (Module 9)

In the `machinelearning.qmd` file, we rerun the above analyses using a machine learning approach. (Module 11)

The code should be run in the order listed above.
